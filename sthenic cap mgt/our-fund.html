            <p>Our fund has invested in a variety of industries, including food and beverage, fintech, healthcare, logistics, telecommunications, and electronic ticketing. We are drawn to businesses that experience difficulties in one or more of inadequate working capital, asset growth issues, procurement troubles, long-term finance, cashflow problems and other occurrences having a major, yet transitory, impact on operations. With a focus on both statutory and technical seniority measures, we prioritize systematic investments that provide a combination of reoccurring income and capital gains, as well as substantial downside protection. The company maintains its reputation as a diversified and solution-driven company with a workforce that is enthusiastic about helping our client’s businesses flourish. With a focus not only on company capabilities but also on thriving industries, such a strategy is able to protect the fund from underperformance and shock in times of economic downturns.</p>
